  <b>AutoXchange</b>
</h2>

AutoXchange is a car buying and selling app for android that I made for the final project for my computer science degree. The user can list cars for sale, view and search for current cars for sale, collect badges from selling cars to display on their profile and communicate with other users on the platform. There is a login system that stores users credentials using Firebase and machine learning is used throughout the app to determine what cars the user sees, prevent the user from listing things which are not cars, and to judge whether cars have been listed for a good price.

## Built With

- Android Studio

- Kotlin

- XML

- Firebase

- Tensorflow

## Features

- Sign up/sign in system that stores user credentials in Firebase.

- Navigation bar to move through the different pages.

- Page to browse through the currently listed cars.

- Search feature to sort through cars based on various criteria (make, model, colour, mileage, etc).

- Page to list new cars that uses Tensorflow to evaluate the images the user has uploaded to prevent images that are not cars from being used. The information the user gives is stored in Firebase.

- Page to view a map with points where each car is.

- Preferences opening sequence to determine the order of cars they could be interested in.

- Profile page to store badges they have collected, display their profile picture and banner.

- Awards system that gives badges to users upon selling certain quantities of cars.

- Ability to customise their profile picture and banner.

- Ability to message other users within the app and send them pictures too.
